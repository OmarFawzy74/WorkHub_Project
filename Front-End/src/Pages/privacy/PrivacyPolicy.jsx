            <h1>2. Our Legal Basis for Using Your Personal Information</h1><br /><br />
            Where relevant under applicable laws, all processing of your personal information will be justified by a "lawful ground" for processing. In the majority of cases, processing will be justified on the legal basis that: <br /><br />
                 1. you have provided your consent for us to use your personal information for a specific purpose; <br /><br />
              2. our use of your personal information is necessary to perform a contract or take steps to enter into a contract with you (e.g. to provide you with services which you have purchased); <br /> <br />
              3. the processing is necessary to comply with a relevant legal obligation or regulatory obligation that we have (e.g. fraud prevention); or <br /><br />
              4. the processing is necessary to support our legitimate interests as a business (e.g. to improve our services to you), subject to your overriding interests and fundamental rights and provided it is conducted at all times in a way that is proportionate. <br /><br />
            <h1>3. How Long Do We Keep Personal Information?</h1> <br /><br />
            We apply a general rule of keeping personal information only for as long as is required to perform the purpose for which it was collected. However, in some circumstances, we will retain your personal information for longer periods of time. We will retain personal information for the following purposes: <br /><br />
            1. as long as it is necessary and relevant for our operations, e.g. so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges; <br /><br />
            2. in relation to personal information from closed accounts to comply with applicable laws, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, enforce our Site terms and take other actions as permitted by law; <br /><br />
            3. to comply with statutory or other obligations to which WorkHub is subject to; and <br /><br />
            4. if and to the extent necessary, we need it to preserve evidence within the statutes of limitation. <br /><br />
            <h1>4. Children</h1> <br /><br />
            This Site is offered and available to users who are at least 18 years of age or older and of legal age to form a binding contract. Minors under 18 and at least 13 years of age, are only permitted to use the Site through an account owned by a parent or legal guardian with their appropriate permission. Minors under 13 are not permitted to use the Site or the WorkHub services. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Parents and guardians should at all times supervise their children's activities. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that personal information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at privacy@WorkHub.com. <br /><br />
            <h1>5. Where We Process Your Personal Information</h1> <br /><br />
            Some of the personal information you provide to us will be stored or processed on our behalf by third party suppliers and data processors and may be located in other jurisdictions, such as the United States and Egypt, whose laws may differ from the jurisdiction in which you live. Whether to third parties or internally, there are also transfers of personal information from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to countries outside of the EEA not deemed to provide an adequate level of data protection from a European data protection perspective, such as the United States. With regard to data transfers to such recipients outside of the EEA we provide appropriate safeguards, in particular, by way of entering into European Union (EU) standard contractual clauses as amended from time to time, and/or equivalent data transfer safeguards. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy. <br /><br />
            <h1>6. Cookies</h1> <br /><br />
            We use cookies and similar technologies (such as web beacons, pixels, tags, and scripts) to improve and personalize your experience, provide our services, analyze website performance and for marketing purposes. Where the use of cookies on our Site involves the processing of your personal information, this Policy applies. The types of cookies used by us and our partners in connection with the Site and our service can be classified into the categories “essential cookies”, “analytics cookies” and “marketing cookies”.<br /><br />

            <h1>7. Do Not Track</h1> <br /><br />
            Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. We do not honor browser requests not to be tracked online (known as “Do Not Track”), but our Cookie Policy describes how you can opt out of receiving cookies.<br /><br />
            <h1>8. External Links</h1> <br /><br />
            Please note that the Site contains links to third party sites and if you navigate to a third party site from the Site, any data you provide to that site and any use of that data by the third party are not under the control of WorkHub and are not subject to this Policy. You should consult the privacy policies of each site you visit. This Policy applies solely to personal information collected by our Site. If you upload content, including personal information, to a social network and then tag the Site, your submission will be subject to that social network's terms of use and privacy policy, even where you post on an official WorkHub page on the social network. We do not have control over these terms of use and privacy policies and have not reviewed their adequacy. You should therefore review these before submitting any personal information.<br /><br />
            <h1>9. Security</h1> <br /><br />
            We implement technical and organizational measures in order to maintain the security of the Site, our services and personal information and in preventing unauthorized access, loss, misuse, alteration, destruction or damage to it through industry standard technologies and internal procedures. Among other things, we regularly maintain a PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards) certification (with respect to payment by credit cards), as required. In addition, we contractually ensure that any third party processing your personal information equally provides for confidentiality and integrity of your data in a secure way. However, the transmission of data via the internet is not completely secure, and although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Site. Once we have received your data, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.<br /><br />
            Users who have registered to the Site agree to keep their password in strict confidence and not disclose such password to any third party.<br /><br />
            Further information about our data security practices can be provided on request.<br /><br />
            <h1>11. Updating Personal Information</h1> <br /><br />
            We take steps to ensure that the personal information we collect is accurate and up to date, and we provide you with the opportunity to update your information through your account profile settings. In the event that you believe your information is in any way incorrect or inaccurate, please let us know immediately. We will make sure we investigate the matter and correct any inaccuracies as quickly as possible where necessary or give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it - unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we will ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request. If for any reason you have a problem with deleting your personal information, please contact WorkHub's Customer Support and we will make reasonable efforts to delete any such information pursuant to any applicable privacy laws.<br /><br />
